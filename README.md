# RSA Implementation
This repository contains a Java-based implementation of three cryptographic scenarios involving RSA encryption. It includes the complete RSA algorithm from scratch, a vulnerability demonstration using a common modulus attack, and a performance comparison between RSA and AES.

## Code Structure

This project includes three key components:

### 1. RSA Key Generation, Encryption, and Decryption

#### üìå Scenario

Implements RSA public-key cryptography using large 1536-bit prime numbers. The process includes generating public and private keys, encrypting a plaintext message, and decrypting the ciphertext using the private key.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

- **Key Generation**
  - Compute modulus: `n = p √ó q`
  - Calculate totient: `œÜ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)`
  - Choose public exponent `e` such that `gcd(e, œÜ(n)) = 1`
  - Compute private exponent: `d = e‚Åª¬π mod œÜ(n)`

- **Encryption**
  - `c = m^e mod n`

- **Decryption using CRT**
  - Compute `dp = d mod (p - 1)` and `dq = d mod (q - 1)`
  - Compute `mp = c^dp mod p`, `mq = c^dq mod q`
  - Use Chinese Remainder Theorem:
    ```
    m = (mp √ó q √ó q‚Åª¬π mod p) + (mq √ó p √ó p‚Åª¬π mod q) mod n
    ```
